# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes a positive integer or zero, and converts it to a string representation.

You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby, such as Integer#to_s, String(), Kernel#format, etc. Your method should do this the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and manipulating the number.

  Input: integer
  Output: string
