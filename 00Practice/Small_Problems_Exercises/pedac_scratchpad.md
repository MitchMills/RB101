# PROBLEM
Given a string of words separated by spaces, write a method that takes this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.

You may assume that every word contains at least one letter, and that the string will always contain at least one word. You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces.

  Input: string: words separated by spaces

  Output: string: first and last letters of each word swapped

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  - every word contains at least one letter
  - every input string conatins at least one word
  - input strings only contain words and spaces, nothing else

  ### implicit
  - one letter strings return "themselves"
  - capitalization is not changed

  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is') == 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
swap('a') == 'a'

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
  - split input string into an array of individual words
  - iterate over the array
    - for each element, switch the first and last letters
  - join the array back into a string
