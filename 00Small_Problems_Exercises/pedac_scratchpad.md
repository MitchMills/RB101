# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. The String may have a leading + or - sign; if the first character is a +, your method should return a positive number; if it is a -, your method should return a negative number. If no sign is given, you should return a positive number.

You may assume the string will always contain a valid number.

You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby, such as String#to_i, Integer(), etc. You may, however, use the string_to_integer method from the previous lesson.

  Input: string
  Output: integer

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit

# EXAMPLES
string_to_signed_integer('4321') == 4321
string_to_signed_integer('-570') == -570
string_to_signed_integer('+100') == 100
