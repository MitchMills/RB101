    To do that, we'll need three pieces of information from you:
        1) the loan amount
        2) the annual percentage rate (APR)
        3) the loan duration
  ready?: "Once you've gathered that information, %{data}, enter any key to continue."

  yes_or_no: "Enter y to confirm and continue. Enter any other key to try again: "
  try_again: "Okay, %{data}, let's try again."
       
  invalid_number: "I'm sorry, %{data}, that's not a valid entry."
  
  loan_amount_instructions: |
    LOAN AMOUNT
       For the loan amount, enter only numbers (and a decimal place if necessary).
       For example, if your loan amount is $10,500.75, enter that as: 10500.75
  loan_amount?: "Please enter your loan amount: "
  loan_amount_correct?: "You entered a loan amount of %{data}. Is that correct?"
  loan_amount: "Loan Amount: %{data}"

  loan_rate_instructions: |
    ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE
       For the annual percentage rate (APR), enter only numbers (and
       a decimal place if necessary).
       For example, if your APR is 7.4 %%, enter that as: 7.4
  loan_rate?: "Please enter your annual percentage rate: "
  loan_rate_correct?: "You entered an APR of %{data}. Is that correct?"
  loan_rate: "APR: %{data}"

  
  loan_duration_instructions: |
    LOAN DURATION
       For the loan duration, enter only whole numbers.
       First you'll enter the number of full years.
       After that you'll enter any additional months.
       
       For example, if your loan duration is 8 1/2 years:
         First enter the number of full years: 8
         Then enter the number of additional months: 6
  loan_duration?: "Please enter the number of %{data}: "
  loan_duration_correct?: "You entered a loan duration of %{data}, is that correct?"
