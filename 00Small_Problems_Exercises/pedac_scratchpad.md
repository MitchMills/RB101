# PROBLEM
If you take a number like 735291, and rotate it to the left, you get 352917. If you now keep the first digit fixed in place, and rotate the remaining digits, you get 329175. Keep the first 2 digits fixed in place and rotate again to 321759. Keep the first 3 digits fixed in place and rotate again to get 321597. Finally, keep the first 4 digits fixed in place and rotate the final 2 digits to get 321579. The resulting number is called the maximum rotation of the original number.

Write a method that takes an integer as argument, and returns the maximum rotation of that argument. You can (and probably should) use the rotate_rightmost_digits method from the previous exercise.

Note that you do not have to handle multiple 0s.

  Input: integer
    - will not have multiple zeros in a row
  Output: integer
    - a leading zero will get dropped during the rotation:
      - 105 => 051 --> 51 => 15

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit
  - number of rotations will be (input integer's length in digits - 1)
  - if input integer only has 1 digit, return that digit
  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
max_rotation(735291) == 321579
max_rotation(3) == 3
max_rotation(35) == 53
max_rotation(105) == 15 # the leading zero gets dropped
max_rotation(8_703_529_146) == 7_321_609_845

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
- iterate over the input integer: number of times = integer length - 1
  - on each iteration, pass the array to `rotate_rightmost_digits`
    - start the value of n at the length of the input integer in digits
      - length - idx
    - decrease the value of n on each iteration
    - save the result
 - return the rotated integer
