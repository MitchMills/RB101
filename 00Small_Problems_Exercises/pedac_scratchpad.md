# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes a string, and returns a new string in which every consonant character is doubled. Vowels (a,e,i,o,u), digits, punctuation, and whitespace should not be doubled.

  Input: string
  Output: new string
    - same characters as input string
    - every consonant character is doubled
    - every other character is not

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit
  - if input string is empty, return an empty string

  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
double_consonants('String') == "SSttrrinngg"
double_consonants("Hello-World!") == "HHellllo-WWorrlldd!"
double_consonants("July 4th") == "JJullyy 4tthh"
double_consonants('') == ""

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
- iterate over each character in the input string
  - if it is a consonant, add it twice to a new string
  - otherwise, add it as is to new string
- return the new string
