# PROBLEM
Write a method that returns an Array that contains every other element of an Array that is passed in as an argument. The values in the returned list should be those values that are in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on elements of the argument Array.

  Input: array

  Output: array
    - consists of every other element of the input array (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc)
  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit
  - if the input array contains only one element, return an array of that element
  - if the input array is empty, return an empty array

# EXAMPLES
oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]
oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 3, 5]
oddities(['abc', 'def']) == ['abc']
oddities([123]) == [123]
oddities([]) == []
oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 1]) == [1, 3, 1]

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
- iterate over the input array
- return every other element, beginning with the first element
  - elements at 0, 2, 4 ...
