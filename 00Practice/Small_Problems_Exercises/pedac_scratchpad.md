# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes two strings as arguments, determines the longest of the two strings, and then returns the result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. You may assume that the strings are of different lengths.

  Input: two strings
          - they will be different lengths

  Output: string: concatenated shorter, longer, shorter

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit


  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
short_long_short('abc', 'defgh') == "abcdefghabc"
short_long_short('abcde', 'fgh') == "fghabcdefgh"
short_long_short('', 'xyz') == "xyz"

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
- determine which string is shorter
- concatenate shorter + longer + shorter
- return concatenated string
