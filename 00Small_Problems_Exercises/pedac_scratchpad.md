# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

  Input: string
  Output: new string

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  - "word" = any sequence of non-space characters
  - each word in new string should have first character upcased and all other characters downcased: 'javaScript' --> 'Javascript'
  ### implicit
  - a word surrounded by quotes should not be capitalized
    - "quoted" --> "quoted"
  - single character words: 'a' --. 'A'

  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

# DATA STRUCTURES


# ALGORITHM
- split the string into an array of "words"
- iterate over the array
  - for each word, upcase the first letter
    - dowcase the rest of the word
- join the array back into a single string
